    <h1>The Best Mac book</h1>

   <p>The best Mac laptop for most people is the 13-inch MacBook Air with Apple’s M2 <br>

    This laptop was formerly our upgrade pick, due to its great screen and MagSafe charging port,<br> but Apple knocked the price down $100 when it released our new upgrade pick, the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.
    
    The 13-inch Air is fantastic for web browsing, working on documents, coding, and light photo and video editing. And for those seeking a large screen,<br> better speakers, and slightly better thermal performance, we recommend the new 15-inch MacBook Air with the M2 processor as our upgrade pick.
    
    We still recommend the M1 MacBook Air as a budget MacBook  <br> It’s a fast, reliable laptop and has already been seen on sale for $200 off its list price since the new, 15-inch M2 MacBook was announced.</p>
